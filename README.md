# Web_Scraping_Challenge
This is my Web scraping challenge submission. All code in this repository is my own.
# Browser info
The web scraping in this repo was done using the Google Chrome browswer. If you plan on running this code, please make sure that you have Google Chrome installed and up to date. 
## part 1: Mars News
The part_1_mars_news ipynb file contains the code to scrape the major headlines and teasers for the Mars Planet website website using the Selenium and Beautifulsoup Python libraries. The code compiles all the headlines and their respective teasers into a list. 
## part 2: Mars Weather
The part_2_mars_weather ipynb file contains code to scrape the information and headings from a table found on the Mars Facts website using the Selenium and Beautifulsoup python libraries. The scraped table was then assembled into a Pandas Dataframe. The average temperature and pressure per Martian month was calculated and plotted using Pandas.plot, and various Mars fun facts were found from the plots and dataframe data.
